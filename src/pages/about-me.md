## How I've started to learn DevOps üöÄ

I started creating my first serious projects in 2021. As far as I can remember I've always been hypnotised by computers and their magic. I've learn to use internet really early and have lost tons of hours in **Minecraft** or **Factorio** since I'm 12. Years passed and I've discovered the first mods along programmation with some games I've played for years. This primitive type of programming with Lua and yaml files have created some curiosity in my mind about creating things with code.
I started learning how works **plugins, then mods** and then I started learning how to do small programs in **Lua** in my spare time.

When I was in secondary school I learnt HTML/CSS and started creating small website. I also bought a book around C basics and I was terrible at it because it was way too much difficult for me but I got some fun from it.

## First serious steps üñ•Ô∏è

In 2019, I went in an high-school with IT and engineering class. I started learning basic of computer science with my first languages like **Python** and **JavaScript**.
Then years passed and as project I've created entire website like forums in **PHP** and first twitch bots to do data analysis. Along with **Python** I learnt OOP and created my first game : a small "**connect four**".
For my 2nd year in high-school I also created a small text game with choices on my calculator. It was pretty fun although not really complicated.

## Exploring Twitch and communities ü§ñ

In 2022 I had to created my first big project for my computer science courses. I choose to create a tool to retrieve data from Twitch and create statistics and analysis with it. It was first built in **Python** with **JSON files** but I rapidly changed for **NodeJS** and **Postgresql** database.
Today this project called "Tungstene Enriched" is still working time to time when I want to use it. Back in 2022 it was really small but nowadays it's way more huge and I've added features throught the years like data monitoring with **Grafana** or automatic process and publish.

The last time this project was used is there : <a href="https://zlan2025.gdoc.fr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">zlan2025.gdoc.fr</a>

## Let's learn DevOps üí°

In 2024, I moved from my small town to Montpellier in France. There I've joined an **engineering school** to learn DevOps and increase my global knowledge about computer science.
After few months I've acquired way much more knowledge than in my entire life, explored many technologies and paradigms. I also do think learning in half-time in the <a href="https://www.cirad.fr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CIRAD</a> which is a company that works around **ecological subjects** and **substainable agriculture**.
I'm in charge of creating new tools for scientifics or maintain existing ones to ensure the good health of the internals IT tools.

## Sharing my experiences üß†

Sharing knowledge and lessons is something really important for me. When I started to learn coding I experienced from many ways failure and deception but those obstacles have enriched me in some way. So when I do something from which I've learnt something I try to **share** it on internet to get feedbacks.
The blog here is an example of this but I also post on my **Twitter** and I've also done a small talk in the <a href="https://polycloud.fr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polycloud 2025</a> to talk about Twitch and the tools I develop. It was a good experience !

> When you share you continue to learn, let's spread knowledge everywhere then !

## What's Next... üöÄ

Since 2020 I'm part of the community group **InGDoc**. With them I create innovative and creative projects about data and internet, since internet will probably never die you can expect me to create a lot of things around it in the next few months. I still have 2 years to go before getting my diploma, this is my next big goal so see you in 2027 !

I'm **Pierre-Louis Leclerc**, and I thank you for reading this.
