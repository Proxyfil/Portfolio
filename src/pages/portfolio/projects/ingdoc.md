The **InGDoc** is a community group created in the idea of providing to some big twitch events tools to make them easily watchable and provide some statistics about them.

## üìñ History

Created in 2020 the team was originally founded to follow the <a href="https://zevent.fr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ZEvent2024</a>. Our first tool was google documents that followed the progress of donation goals and amount raised.
In **2022** we start collecting more data about streams and create infographics at the end of the different events that we follow.

We have worked along some organisations to create custom tools and we still bring ideas of the community to life.
Our website is a collection of all the work we have made so far like creating atlas for **r/place-like events** or entire gsheets to follow **WoW Progresses**.
You can also see the effort of documentation made by the community to follow **RPZ**, a roleplay event on GTA V that united more than 100 streamers to come play and create stories for 2 weeks straight.
